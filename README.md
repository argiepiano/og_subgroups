# Organic Groups Subgroups

## Description

This module enables a user with the proper permissions to build group hierarchies (or tree) by nesting groups under other groups. Simple or complex group hierarchies can be easily created.

When a hierarchy has been established, user memberships and/or content posted to a group can be propagated up, down or sideways along the tree. So when a user joins a group, their membership can also get created in other parent, child or sibling groups. Separate propagation settings can be applied for content and membership propagation.
