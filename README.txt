DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
The Organic Groups Subgroups module (also referred to as the 'og_subgroups' module), 
provides users the ability to inherit permission on subgroups, since og7 a group
can be part of an other group so we already got the hierarchy system in place,
what is missing is the ability of a parent group member to automatically get 
the same permissions on his subgroups, since he is not nessecery a group member
on each and every group, he will not get access to the same permission.
This is the current functionalty, in the future we will have more.
